      "Atheon designs, builds and maintains custom AI agents and business automations. We connect your customer conversations, business information and existing tools so everyday tasks can move through a clear process.",

    title: "Why choose Atheon?",
    description:
      "We build around your business process and the tools you already use. You get an agreed scope, clear running costs and a system tested with your team before launch. Choose an Atheon-managed subscription or deployment on your own infrastructure, with support responsibilities defined from the start.",

    title: "What’s the difference between AI agents and automation?",
    description:
      "Automation follows defined rules and steps, such as sending a reminder when a booking is confirmed. An AI agent can interpret a message, use relevant information and choose the next step within the rules you set. They can work together: the agent understands the request, and connected automations carry out the actions.",

    title: "How will our data be handled?",
    description:
      "Before launch, we agree which data the workflow uses, who can access it, where it is processed and which external providers are involved. Access controls, approval steps, retention, deletion and support responsibilities are defined for your setup. Deployment on your own infrastructure can still involve third-party AI or integration services; it does not automatically mean all data stays on your server. Our privacy policy explains how this website and business enquiries are handled.",

  {
    id: "tools",
    title: "Can you work with our existing software?",
    description:
      "We assess the tools involved and how they can connect. Integration depends on the access, APIs and capabilities each platform provides. Any limitations and required subscriptions are discussed before the build.",

    id: "time",
    title: "How long does a project take?",
    description:
      "Most automation projects take 1 to 3 weeks. More complex integrations or larger workflows may take longer. Your project’s expected timeline is confirmed once the scope is agreed.",

    title: "How are pricing and running costs handled?",

      "Pricing depends on the project scope and delivery option. We clarify development, hosting, third-party platform and usage costs in the proposal, including the ongoing subscription or support arrangement that applies.",

    description:
      "We show your team how the system works. Managed subscriptions include the maintenance and support defined in your agreement. For deployment on your own infrastructure, we agree on handover, maintenance and support responsibilities separately.",
